## Introduction
With the continuous development of AI, its economic impact on individual countries and regions is becoming more prominent. Many studies have shown that AI has the potential to increase productivity, although it may cause short-term labor market disruptions. This project explores the critical role of artificial intelligence (AI) in shaping countries' economic competitiveness, emphasizing key factors influencing national AI capabilities. The study employs cluster analysis, comparative analysis, and predictive models to address key research questions.

## Research Questions

### **RQ1: How do investments in education and technology impact AI competitiveness across different clusters of countries?**
**Hypothesis 1:** Investments in technology have a greater impact on AI competitiveness across different clusters of countries than investments in education.  
**Method 1:** Cluster Analysis

### **RQ2: How does a country's investment in education affect its high-tech development and competitiveness in AI?**
**Hypothesis 2:** There is a positive correlation between investment in education and the country's high-tech AI competitiveness.  
**Method 2:** Time Series Analysis

## Data Description
This dataset consists of the **AI Global Index dataset** and **five indicators** related to scientific and technological development:
- **Edu_GDP**: Government expenditure on education
- **Sci_articles**: Number of scientific and technical journal articles
- **H_exports**: High-tech exports (% of manufactured exports)
- **Mh_exports**: Medium and high-tech exports (% of manufactured exports)
- **Technicians**: Technicians in R&D (per million people)

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Loaded dataset into R and removed unnecessary columns.
- Addressed missing values using interpolation or estimation.
- Standardized data types and removed redundant rows.
- Managed outliers and coded categorical variables.

---

## Analytical Techniques
### **Cluster Analysis**
- Used **K-means clustering** to categorize countries based on education and technology investments.
- Identified patterns and their impact on AI competitiveness.

### **Time Series Analysis**
- Applied **ARIMA models** to analyze education investments and their impact on high-tech competitiveness from 2000 to 2023.
- Predicted future trends and tested the hypothesis that education investment positively impacts technological advancement.

---

## Cluster Analysis
### **Data Suitability & Standardization**
- Due to missing values, interpolation proved inadequate, leading to removal of incomplete observations.
- Standardized data using **R's `scale` function**, converting values into **z-scores**.

### **Clustering Approach**
- Categorized data into **technology and education** variables.
- Used **multinomial logistic regression** to determine key factors differentiating clusters.
- Evaluated countries' AI progression based on cluster classification.

### **R Tools Used**
- `readr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `cluster`, `ggplot2`, `lm`, `nnet`

### **Results**
- **Cluster 1**: Low AI investment (mostly African nations)
- **Cluster 2**: Moderate investment (developing & developed nations)
- **Cluster 3**: High investment (USA, China, and other AI leaders)

---

## Trend Analysis & Prediction
- **Technology investment is a major driver** of AI development.
- The **USA leads in education and technology investment**, correlating with AI advancements.
- **Predictions over the next 5 years** indicate that technology investment will continue to drive AI competitiveness more than education alone.

### **Findings**
- **India:** Education investments correlate positively with high-tech AI competitiveness.
- **Brazil:** Forecasting results were inconsistent, suggesting insufficient data or high variability.

---

## Time Series Analysis
### **Data Selection & Methodology**
- Examined data from **2000 to 2023** for the **US, China, UK, India, and Brazil**.
- Variables selected: **education spending, scientific journal articles, high-tech exports, medium-high tech exports, R&D technicians**.
- **ARIMA model applied** for forecasting trends and testing investment impact.

### **Key Findings**
- A **positive correlation exists** between **education investment and AI competitiveness**.
- Countries with **stable R&D investment** show **higher high-tech exports and AI growth**.

---

## Conclusion
- **Education and technology investments** significantly influence AI competitiveness.
- **Countries leading in AI (USA, China, UK)** exhibit **higher education funding and R&D investment**.
- **Challenges in data gaps and measurement inconsistencies** require advanced analytical approaches.
- **Technology investment plays a primary role** in driving AI growth.
